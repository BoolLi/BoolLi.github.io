My name is Li Li and I am currently a student in Bucknell University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.<br>
<br> 
I have lots of interests, but computer science, especially web development, is my favorite. I love elegant code, and I want my code to be concise and understandable to others. <br>
<br>
I like to develop Ruby on Rails applications and Chrome extensions, and I am currently learning Android development.
