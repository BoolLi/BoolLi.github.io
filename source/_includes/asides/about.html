  <h1>About Me</h1>
  My name is Li Li and I am currently a student in Bucknell University, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I have lots of interests, but computer science, especially web development, is my favorite. I love elegant code, and I want my code to be concise and understandable to others.
